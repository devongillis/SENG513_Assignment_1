		<h2>Gameplay</h2>
		
		<p>
		Each player on their turn will play one card from their hand and place into one of 
		their own run piles or the shared discard piles (respective of that suit) and then 
		pick up a card either from the shared discard piles (if any cards are present) or 
		the draw deck (picking up a card marks the end of your turn). When the last card 
		has been drawn from the draw pile the game immediately ends (this means the last 
		card is not playable).
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Each card has a respective point value except for face cards and aces (these are 
		multiplier and wild cards), 2 is worth 2 points and 10 is worth 10 points. Face cards 
		multiply the final point total at the end of the game.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Ace is wild, King is a multiplier, Queen is a multiplier, Jack is a multiplier, 10 is a point card

		Except for the discard piles, cards must be laid down so that each new card 
		in the run is higher than the previous for that suit (can play a 5 on a 2 but not a 2 on
		a 5).

		<p>
		Aces act as wild cards and when played will immediately act as the “next” card up,
		up to the value of 10. (Think of an ace as a way to bypass a lower card you don’t yet 
		have, if the ten has already been played then the ace is worthless as there is no nigher card than a ten. aces can only act 
		as point cards, not multiplier cards). Here the ace is acting as a 4.

		<p>
		Multiplier cards are played before the point cards (think of them having point values 
		of zero) and more than one multiplier can be played in a run. They also don't need to 
		be played in the order JQK.

		<p>
		Once 
		a card has been played in your own run pile it cannot be removed. When starting a 
		pile an automatic 20 point deduction is applied to that pile thus the equation to calculate your 
		total for that pile at the end of the run is:
		</p>
		
		<p>
		(card_points - 20) * (1 + multiplier_cards) = new_total
		</p>
		
		<p>
		This means that if your card points don't atleast match 20, then you will score negative in that run.
		Note: you can start as many or as few runs as you want.

		</div>
		<p>
		If you have the KQ234A79 in a run then you first add 2 + 3 + 4 + 5(ace is
		in this case worth 5) + 7 + 9 = 30, you also have two multiplier cards (K and Q), thus your point total is:
		</p>
		
		<p>
		(30 - 20) * (1 + 2) = (10) * (3) = 30
		</p>
		
		<p>
		You have scored 30 points in that pile.
		</p>
		
		<h3>
		Sample Senario 2:
		</h3>
		<div class= "card_blocks empty4">
			<div class= "card_block">
				<div class="card H_J">
					<img src="cards.png" alt="cards">
				</div>
				<div class="card H_3 layered_slot_down">
					<img src="cards.png" alt="cards">
				</div>
				<div class="card H_A layered_slot_down">

				</div>
				<div class="card H_7 layered_slot_down">

				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>
		If you have the J3A7 in a run then you first add 2 + 3 + 4(ace is
		in this case worth 4) + 7 = 14, you also have one multiplier card (J), thus your point total is:
		</p>
		
		<p>
		(14 - 20) * (1 + 1) = (-6) * (2) = -12
		</p>
		
		<p>
		You have scored -12 points in that pile.
		</p>
		
		<h3>
		Notes about runs:
		</h3>
		
		<p>
		The strongest run is of course when 12 cards are present with the ace being able to replace
		any one of point cards, in the order:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>J,Q,K</li>
			<li>J,Q,K</li>
			<li>J,Q,K</li>
			<li>2</li>
			<li>3</li>
			<li>4</li>
			<li>5</li>
			<li>6</li>
			<li>7</li>
			<li>8</li>
			<li>9</li>
			<li>10</li>
		</ol> 
		
		
		<h3>
		Totaling up points
		</h3>
		
		<p>
		Each pile is tallied up and the scores are combined, the game consists of 3 rounds, (or any 
		number you please). the winner is whom ever achieves the highest score at the end of the game.
